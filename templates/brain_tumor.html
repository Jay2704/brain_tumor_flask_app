        <h1>About Brain Tumors</h1>
        <p>Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells within the brain or central nervous system. They can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Tumors can develop within the brain (**primary brain tumors**) or spread from other parts of the body (**metastatic brain tumors**).</p>

        <h2>Common Symptoms of Brain Tumors</h2>
        <p>Symptoms vary depending on the size, type, and location of the tumor. Common signs include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Persistent headaches, often worse in the morning</li>
            <li>Seizures or convulsions</li>
            <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
            <li>Weakness or numbness in specific body parts</li>
            <li>Vision or speech difficulties</li>
            <li>Cognitive or personality changes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Brain Tumors</h2>

        <div class="tumor-section">
            <h3>Meningioma</h3>
            <p>Meningiomas arise from the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. They account for about 37% of all brain tumors. Most are benign, but larger tumors can press on brain tissue and cause complications.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Headaches, weakness or numbness in limbs, memory difficulties, and vision changes.</p>
            <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Observation, surgery, or radiation therapy depending on the size and symptoms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tumor-section">
            <h3>Glioma</h3>
            <p>Gliomas originate in the glial cells, which support and protect neurons in the brain. Gliomas include subtypes such as astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and glioblastomas. These tumors can range from slow-growing to highly aggressive.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Seizures, headaches, cognitive changes, and vision problems.</p>
            <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, often combined for aggressive forms like glioblastoma.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tumor-section">
            <h3>Pituitary Tumors</h3>
            <p>Pituitary tumors develop in the pituitary gland, a pea-shaped organ at the base of the brain responsible for hormone regulation. These tumors can be hormone-producing (functional) or non-functional. Functional tumors can lead to hormone imbalances.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Hormonal imbalances, vision problems, fatigue, weight changes, and mood swings.</p>
            <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Medications to regulate hormones, surgery, and radiation therapy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Diagnosis of Brain Tumors</h2>
        <p>Brain tumors are diagnosed using a combination of imaging tests, neurological exams, and biopsies. Common diagnostic tools include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):</strong> Provides detailed images of the brain to identify abnormal growths.</li>
            <li><strong>CT Scans:</strong> Helps detect tumors and evaluate swelling in the brain.</li>
            <li><strong>Biopsy:</strong> Involves removing a sample of tissue for laboratory analysis to determine the tumor type.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
        <p>Treatment varies based on the type, location, and stage of the tumor:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> Removing as much of the tumor as possible while preserving brain function.</li>
            <li><strong>Radiation Therapy:</strong> Targeted radiation to destroy tumor cells or reduce tumor size.</li>
            <li><strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> Drugs used to kill or slow the growth of tumor cells.</li>
            <li><strong>Targeted Therapy:</strong> Medications designed to target specific mutations in tumor cells.</li>
            <li><strong>Observation:</strong> For benign tumors that do not cause symptoms, regular monitoring may be sufficient.</li>
        </ul>
